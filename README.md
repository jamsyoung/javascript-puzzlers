# JavaScript Puzzlers
I ran across these on [Adobe TV][0].  Thought they were fun to play with.  I
have converted them slightly to run in node for quick testing on command line.

Here is the presenters contact information:

- GitHub: [github.com/charlesbihis][3]

## How to run
To run a puzzler, just execute it from the command line like this:

    $ node puzzler-01.js

This assumes you have [node.js][1] installed.
